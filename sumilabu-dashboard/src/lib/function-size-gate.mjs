 * than `FUNCTION_GROWTH_ALLOWED` over the size recorded for it in the baseline.
 * John, 2026-09-23: "no more than 20% sounds reasonable." The ceiling stops a
 * disaster; it does not stop a function drifting from 21 MB to 100 without
 * anybody looking - which is where these were before the Prisma trim, and
 * every megabyte of it counts against the Functions Storage every project on
 * the account shares.
 *
 * Kept in plain JavaScript so `scripts/check-function-sizes.mjs` runs it with
 * bare `node` in the deploy job, and the unit test imports the same code.
 * umakuma holds the same rules in `src/lib/functionSizeGate.mjs`.
