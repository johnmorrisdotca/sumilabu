/**
 * Refuses a build whose server functions are too big, or have grown too much,
 * before any of it is uploaded.
 *
 * Vercel rejects a function over 250 MB uncompressed, and it says so only
 * after the whole build has been uploaded: umakuma's 1.539.0 uploaded 226 MB
 * three times over and failed each time on a 278 MB function, and a refused
 * deploy still costs a slot of the hundred a day the shared account allows.
 * Every function also counts against the Functions Storage every project on
 * the account shares, so a function that creeps towards the limit is a
 * problem well before it reaches it: the two here carried 102 MB each, four
 * fifths of it Prisma engines for machines Vercel does not run, until
 * `next.config.ts` trimmed the trace to 21 MB.
 *
 * Two limits, from `src/lib/function-size-gate.mjs`: no function over 120 MB,
 * and none more than 20% and more than 5 MB over the size recorded for it in
 * `scripts/function-sizes.baseline.json`. A function the baseline does not
 * know has the ceiling alone.
 *
 * Reads `.vercel/output/functions` as `vercel build` leaves it - on the CI
 * runner, so it measures the Linux build that ships rather than a Mac's. A
 * function is a `.func` folder (the symlinked ones are routes sharing another's
 * bundle); its size is the files in it plus every file its `.vc-config.json`
 * maps in from the project, which is how Vercel counts it. Only `stat`, so it
 * takes a fraction of a second.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-function-sizes.mjs            check against both limits
 *   node scripts/check-function-sizes.mjs --record   write this build's sizes as the baseline
 *   FUNCTION_SIZE_LIMIT_MB=150 node scripts/...      another ceiling
 *
 * A deliberate change in size is recorded in the same commit as the change,
 * with `pnpm functions:size --record`, so a reviewer sees the jump in the diff.
 *
 * To measure locally without pulling the project's secrets, give `vercel build`
 * its settings by hand in `.vercel/project.json` - `{"projectId":"local",
 * "orgId":"local","settings":{"framework":"nextjs","nodeVersion":"24.x"}}` -
 * then run `vercel build --yes` in this folder. A Mac's build comes within a
 * fraction of a megabyte of the CI runner's, since the trace keeps only
 * Prisma's Linux engine whichever machine built it.
